Hash ZK-Verify
a visual & educational Zero-Knowledge Proof playground.

Hash ZK-Verify is an open-source toolkit designed to help beginners learn, test, and understand Zero-Knowledge Proofs through interactive examples and simple circuit logic.

This project is built to prepare developers for the future of Web4, decentralized identity, AI privacy, and advanced cryptographic systems all powered by ZK.

---

🎯 Project Purpose
Most ZK tools are too advanced for beginners. 
Hash ZK-Verify solves that by giving learners:

- Simple ZK circuits
- Visual logic (later UI support) 
- Easy proof generation
- Clear verification results
- Real-life examples (age, password, finance)
- Beginner-friendly documentation

You don’t need deep math to understand ZK, this toolkit teaches it practically.

🌐 Core Features

✅ Circuit Builder
- Build ZK circuits programmatically (later UI).

✅ Proof Generator
- Generate proofs using beginner friendly circuits.

✅ Proof Verifier
- Verify proofs and understand why they are valid.

✅ Real-World ZK Examples
- Password verification without revealing password
- Age verification without DOB
- Financial solvency proof without showing balance

✅ REST API
- Frontend, mobile apps, or other tools can connect easily.
